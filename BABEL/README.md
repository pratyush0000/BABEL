# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Team: In our collaborative effort, Pratyush and Paresh spearheaded the design and implemented the website's conceptual framework. Meanwhile, Diya and Urvi focused on enhancing functionalities and establishing crucial API connections. This holistic approach ensured a comprehensive integration of design and functionality, showcasing the synergy of our team's skills in crafting a seamless and feature-rich website.
Tech Used: The project was built using the React+vite framework. It uses the Microsoft Azure Api to translate the text and the OpenAI api to modify it
Idea Description: Our project, an AI-driven artistic translation platform, uniquely fuses art and technology. It seamlessly bridges the gap between languages, cultures, and expressions, offering a novel perspective on communication. This innovation addresses the evolving challenges of future technologies by promoting cross-cultural understanding and collaboration through the captivating medium of AI-driven translations.
How to Run the Project: Install node on the system. Do npm install. Use npm run dev to proceed
Explain the Core Code: At the core of our project lies a robust codebase integrating Microsoft Azure API for initial language translation across diverse languages. This translated text is then processed through OpenAI, leveraging both the original and translated versions to enhance contextual accuracy. By addressing nuances lost in traditional translation services, our code ensures a refined and nuanced output. This sophisticated fusion of Azure and OpenAI technologies empowers our platform to transcend language barriers, preserving the essence of communication in a globalized context.
